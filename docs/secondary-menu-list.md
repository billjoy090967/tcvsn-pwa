Things to do:

- pass in some type of information (boolean, secondary? menu component?) as a prop into **menuAppBar.js**.   
- Build the secondary menu component with individual menu items:
  - edit (routes/links to /resources/:id/edit)
  - delete  (routes/links to /resources/:id/delete) (initially disabled until we get delete up and running)

- Create app route for resources and category deletes
