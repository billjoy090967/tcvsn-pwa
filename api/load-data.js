When service members return home, they have access to several programs and American Red Cross volunteers who are ready and willing to ease the transition from deployment or discharge into the civilian sector. Programs provided include, but are not limited to, emergency financial assistance referrals, disaster preparedness and response, reconnection and family mental health education, resiliency training to cope with the challenges of life in the military, and supportive transitional services for wounded soldiers and their family members. We also offer volunteer opportunities in all lines of service.  To initiate an Emergency Communication Message, call 1-877-272-7337 when you need to contact a service member in the event of a family emergency. This service is available 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.',
