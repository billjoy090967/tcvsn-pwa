After 28 years of distinguished military service with the US Air Force Reserve Nurse Corps, taking her to numerous global hot spots, Eileen continued to dedicate herself to the service of her fellow Veterans and families. Among her many accolades, Eileen was presented the Presidential Call to Service Award by President George W. Bush, honoring her example of service to Veterans in performing over 20,000 Red Cross volunteer hours with the Service to the Armed Forces (SAF) and International Services at the American Red Cross Lowcountry Chapter.
